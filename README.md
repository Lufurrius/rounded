***Rounded*** is a Vanilla+ mod which aims to round out (pun intended) the features of the base game.

The initial release of the mod is version 1.0.0, titled **Round of Applause**. It was made for [ModFest: Carnival](https://modfest.net/carnival).

## Features
- **Treated Planks**, made with some planks and a honeycomb, which mobs won't walk over;
- The **Trough**, which given some grain heals nearby animals and helps baby animals grow;
- **Lustershrooms**, found in swamps, old growth taigas, groves and (in greater quantities) in dark forests, can be grown with bonemeal and have their cap harvested to create **Luster Clusters**, which provide enchanting power.

More features will be added in future versions of the mod!
